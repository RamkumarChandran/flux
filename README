Flux is a project consolidating our experiences with jBPM5 in a Java EE 6 environment. 

It is a small CDI module where all aspects described in our appertaining blog post (http://blog.akquinet.de/2012/04/13/use-jbpm5-embedded-within-a-java-ee-6-application/) and other additional aspects like the integration of the TaskService are covered. With this CDI module you can easily embed jBPM5 in your web application and use arbitrary process definitions. 

Currently we are planning and designing the support of a business scope and a forge plugin for generating code from a process definition. The aim of the generator is to take a particular process definition and to generate all needed artifacts like WorkItemHandlers or Forms using the Flux API. A blog post and a tutorial for our framework will follow.

The first demo version will be published soon...
