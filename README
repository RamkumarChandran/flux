Flux is a project consolidating our experiences with jBPM5 in a Java EE 6 environment. 

It is a small CDI module where all aspects described in our appertaining blog post (http://blog.akquinet.de/2012/04/13/use-jbpm5-embedded-within-a-java-ee-6-application/) and other additional aspects like the integration of the TaskService are covered. With this CDI module you can easily embed jBPM5 in your web application and use arbitrary process definitions. 

Currently we are planning and designing the support of a business scope and a forge plugin for generating code from a process definition. The aim of the generator is to take a particular process definition and to generate all needed artifacts like WorkItemHandlers or Forms using the Flux API. A blog post and a tutorial for our framework will follow.

This is our first public version of the Flux project which uses the latest jbpm5.4-Snapshot and drools5.5-Snapshots.

Have a look on our example jee6 web application. The example will show you, how to use jbpm5-flux for developing a web application.

A documentation will be published soon as possible...

Quickstart:
1. build jbpm5-flux with maven: mvn install

2. build myHoliday with maven:
2.A use myHoliday with localTaskService: mvn install -Dtaskserver.local
2.B use myHoliday with TaskService with Mina implementation: mvn install -Dtaskserver.mina

3. Deploy on JBoss AS 7
3.A Use JBoss AS 7.1 with the LocalTaskService
3.B Use JBoss AS 7.0 with the MinaTaskService

4. Start the Server and go to: http://localhost:8080/myHoliday/
